Militech Grenade Concept Fan art
---
Added fusion 360 recently to my arsenal and this is the second concept I'm trying to recreate.
Its a fanart Militech grenade from the game Cyberpunk 2077.
Made in fusion, optimized in Blender roughly around 8.4k tris.
Added some flare with a second batch of textures taken from well known soda companies.
The inspiration came from Filippo Ubertino and his lovely renders of grenades for the aforementioned game.
