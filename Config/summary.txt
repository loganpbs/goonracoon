As a Character and Prop Artist, I am currently working privately on "Paragon Enclave: Orion Stronghold" with a small indie team. 
My previous clients include industry staples such as Tencent, Playdemic, Behaviour Interactive, Rovio, and Kabam.
 I have also contributed to the successful shipping of "Shardfall" by Quell. With three years of experience in CGI and game productions,
  my expertise primarily lies in creating detailed characters, intricate weapons, and unique environment props.
